|BMI Calculator Test Plan|

#Test Plan Identifier:
BMI calculator test plan version 1 Introduction:
Summary This test plan will feature all activities required to perform adequate testing for the BMI Calculator . BMI Calculator, which will be developed in Visual Basic, will run on various Windows operating systems will need to tested on various platforms with all identified test cases.

#Test Items BMI Calculator v1.0 The calculator will be supported on the following operating systems, so it will need to be tested on all these platforms: 1.Windows Vista 2.Windows 7 3.Linux #References 1.Requirements doc.xlsx2 2.Design_Document.docx

#References to bug reports:(Not available yet)

#Features to be Tested 1.Installation of BMI Calculator in the supported Windows operating systems 2.Inputs that the BMI Calculator will accept 3.Outputs that the BMI Calculator will display 4.Spell check of all text displayed in the application 5.Performance testing for output

#Features Not to Be Tested 1)No Load testing will be performed since the application cannot be used by multiple users simultaneously 2)No Security testing will be performed as the application will not contain identifiable informationfor the user.

#Approach: 1)Overall approach to testing Functional and performance testing will be performed on the BMI Calculator. There is no need to perform unit or integration testing as the application has a small number of features,which will be coveredin the basic functional testing.

#Performance Testing Performed manually by checking the response times of outputs and how long it takes to launch BMI calculator.

#Requirementsâ€™ tracing Each test case will identify which Requirements it covers2.Test case will be marked as Passed/Failed/Not tested yet to display its status

#Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements Testing may be suspended if 1.A blocker bug exists 2.Thetest machines are disabled Testing activities which must be redone when testing is resumed 1.Installation of BMI Calculator 2.Smoke test of BMI Calculator 3.Regression of basic functionality

#Test Deliverables 1)Deliverabledocuments: 1.Test plan, 2.Test cases 3.BugReports #Test Input Height: 80cm to 200cm, abc Weight: 12kg to 200kg, abc Age: 2 year to 100 year, abc Test Output: BMI: 0-100 Height: [same number as input] Weight: [same number as input] There are no testing tools used for this application. All testing will be performed manually.

#Testing Tasks Tasks necessary to prepare for and perform testing 1.Install DLLs for running Visual Basic Applications 2.Install BMI Calculator 3.Run BMI Calculator4.Perform Functional Testing5.Perform Performance Testing. 4.Regress on different Windows operating system TaskinterdependenciesBMI Calculator will not run if the appropriate DLLs are not installed Specialskills required QA Analyst must be able to diagnose and recreate the exact steps needed for the bug to occur and provide possible workarounds
